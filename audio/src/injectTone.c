/*
 * injectTone — proof-of-concept generator for forceAudioJack.so.
 *
 * Creates the /forceAudioInject shared-memory ring and continuously writes a
 * sine wave into it, paced to real time. forceAudioJack.so (LD_PRELOAD'd into
 * MPC) mixes this into whatever MPC reads from its capture device.
 *
 * This is deliberately dumb - a real MIDI-generator renderer would replace
 * this process, writing rendered note audio into the same ring instead of a
 * fixed tone. The point of this program is only to prove the injection path
 * end-to-end: if the tone shows up in forceAudioJack.so's logged peak/consumed
 * counters (or audibly on an Audio-In track), the mechanism works.
 *
 * `--slot N` (default 0) picks which voice slot's shared-memory segment this
 * instance creates, so it can also be used to smoke-test forceAudioJack.so's
 * multi-voice mixing (e.g. run two instances at different `--slot`/freq/
 * `--channel` to confirm they mix independently).
 *
 * `--bus in|out` (default in) picks the In-bus (Audio-In 1/2 injection,
 * the original feature) or Out-bus (physical Out 3/4 injection) ring
 * namespace - see AI_SHM_NAME_FMT_OUT in forceAudioInject.h. On `--bus
 * out`, `--channel L|R|LR` means "Out 3"/"Out 4"/both rather than L/R, and
 * `--slot` is clamped to AI_MAX_OUT_VOICES instead of AI_MAX_VOICES.
 *
 * Usage: injectTone [freqHz] [gain0to1] [channels(1|2)] [--slot N] [--channel L|R|LR] [--bus in|out]
 *
 * BUILD:
 *   zig cc -target arm-linux-gnueabihf.2.39 -O2 \
 *       -o injectTone injectTone.c -lpthread -lrt -lm

         * over-correction). Match the margin to the measured drift, don't

         * is ~5.8M here (BLOCK_FRAMES/GEN_RATE). A finer-grained fraction
         * like *985/1000 overflows that 32-bit multiply (5.8M * 985 ~=
         * 5.7 billion, past INT32_MAX) and silently wraps to a much
         * smaller value - the sleep becomes far too SHORT, not too long,
         * so the symptom looks like "overproducing again" (confirmed: this
         * exact mistake was made and caught here on 2026-09-23). Keep the
