/*
 * Shared memory layout between the injector process(es) (e.g. injectTone,
 * maze_host, or any future audio-rendering voice host built the same way)
 * and forceAudioJack.so, the LD_PRELOAD shim that mixes injected audio into
 * what /usr/bin/MPC reads from its capture device.
 *
 * The producer (injector) always writes 32-bit float, mono or stereo, at a
 * fixed rate it declares in the header. forceAudioJack.so does the conversion
 * to whatever format/channel count MPC actually configured on the capture
 * handle - the producer never needs to know or care what MPC is doing.
 *
 * MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS VOICES: each voice host is the sole producer of its
 * OWN ring, in its own shared-memory segment, named by a small integer slot
 * (AI_SHM_NAME_FMT). forceAudioJack.so attaches to every slot that exists
 * (0..AI_MAX_VOICES-1) and sums them all into the one real capture buffer -
 * this keeps every ring genuinely single-producer/single-consumer (no
 * cross-process synchronization needed beyond what already exists per ring)
 * rather than trying to make one ring handle multiple writers. A voice with
 * no shared-memory segment present is simply not attached - same
 * "disabled by default, passthrough-only" contract as before, per slot.
 *
 * PER-VOICE MIX CONTROL: `enabled`/`gain`/`channel_mask` are the host-level
 * "voice out" controls (on/off, volume, L/R/L+R routing) a voice's own
 * control socket writes directly - there is no separate central mixer
 * process. `enabled` mutes the *mix*, not the render: forceAudioJack.so still
 * drains the ring at the normal rate while muted (see forceAudioJack.c's
 * mix_in) so a re-enabled voice doesn't resume from a stale backlog, and the
 * producer's render cadence - which is the synth's actual clock for envelopes
 * and filters - is never told to skip a tick.
