# Native (host-arch) build + run of the mixing/attach unit test. No Docker,
# no cross toolchain, no real device or ALSA needed - test_mix.c #includes
# the real src/forceAudioJack.c directly and exercises its static functions
# (mix_in_one, chan_allowed, ai_try_attach) against synthetic in-process
# ai_shm_t structs and real POSIX shared memory. See test_mix.c's own header
# comment for exactly what this can and can't validate.
